# NetworkProgramming
My excercises from the class "Data communication and network programming"
https://www.ntnu.no/studier/emner/TDAT2004#tab=omEmnet

* Exercise 1 - [Finding prime numbers within a intervall with threads](/exercise1)
* Exercise 2 - [Worker threads with event loop, using condition variable and mutex lock](/exercise2)
* Exercise 3 - [Online code runner, using Docker for virtualisation and security](/exercise3)
* Exercise 4 - [Distributed programming with TCP-Sockets and simple HTTP server](/exercise4)
* Exercise 5 - [Distributed programming using UDP](/exercise5)
* Exercise 6 - [ORM using Persistence and Java](/exercise6)
* Exercise 7 - [Create a simple websocket library using standard rfc6455](/exercise7)
* Exercise 8 - Continous deployment 

// Exercise 8 does not have any code for this, as it was solved using passwordless ssh, and Gitlab's CI. The assignment was solved using SSH and Gitlab yml configuration. YML configuration sets up rsync for syncing diffed files, and using systemd for rebooting a server.
